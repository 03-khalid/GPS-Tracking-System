# GPS-Tracking-System

This repository contains code and resources for the GPS tracking system which is implemented using ESP32 and GSM A7672s development board.

##Objectives

• The main purpose of Real-Time Tracking is that the system should provide real-time
tracking of college buses, allowing students and administrators to know the exact
location of each bus at any given time.
• Develop and implement an IoT device with appropriate sensors for location sensing
in each bus.
• Configure the IoT device to periodically send the location coordinates to a database
for storage.
• Design and develop a web and/or mobile application to store and manage the location
data received from the IoT devices.
• Incorporate alerting mechanisms into the system to notify stakeholders of any issues,
such as bus delays, route deviations, or accidents.
• The system should reduce wait times for students at bus stops by providing accurate
arrival and departure times of buses.
